                    Q.What is ‘Script Registration’ (Online & Offline) with FilmGinny Corporation (FGC)?

                    <p>
                        A.Registering your literary and dramatic work like story, screenplay, script, etc. (Work)
                        with FilmGinny Corporation (FGC) means creating a public record of the date of the
                        creation of your Work. Means, the registration is prima facie evidence in the case of the
                        dispute related to first date of creation of work.

                        For example, if two people have registered the identical story on different dates.
                        Subsequently, a dispute arises regarding the real author of this story. The adjudicating
                        authority shall first look into the date of the registration. The person who has registered
                        first shall be considered as prima facie author and, the burden of proof shall shift to
                        another party who denies the same.

                        Let’s assume another scenario to understand the benefit of the registration. Mr. A released
                        a film on 5th October 2020. Mr. B released another film with a substantially
                        similar/identical storyline year 1st January 2021. Now, Mr. A sues Mr. B for copyright
                        infringement. Mr. B can defend himself if he proves that he has registered the script of his
                        film before 5th October 2020. Act of registration shows that the Writer is the prima facie
                        author of the work. It is the reason why most of the production houses/platforms accept only
                        registered work to consider. SWA registration is widely accepted in the industry and hence,
                        sending a registered work through a proper channel appears more professional than randomly
                        sharing your unregistered work.

                        A. An author has to give the following declaration while registering any work with SWA.

                        I, ______ aged _______ s/o OR d/o Mr./Ms. ________ hereby solemnly undertake and declare
                        that;

                        A. I am the author of this literary/ dramatic work (Work). In the case of co-authorship
                        work, I have taken permission from my co-authors before registration. Further, I have
                        declared the name of the co-authors while registering the Work.

                        B. If I am the Author but not the Copyright Owner of the Work, I have taken due written
                        permission from the Copyright Owner to register the Work.

                        C. If the Work is a derivative work, I have duly taken written permission from the original
                        author/owner to create this derivative work.

                        D. I understand that the purpose of registering the Work with SWA is only to create a record
                        of the date of the creation of my Work.

                        E. This Work (along with its underlying works) does not infringe the intellectual property
                        rights or any other related rights of a person or entity. In case it is found the contrary,
                        I understand that registration will automatically stand cancelled. Besides, I will be solely
                        responsible for the legal and disciplinary consequences whatsoever.

                        F. I fully understand that any tampering with this document will make this registration null
                        and void. I declare that I have duly read and understood the rules and regulations, and FAQs
                        of SWA regarding the registration of a work and membership eligibility criteria.

                        G. I understand and acknowledge that SWA does not read, access, verify, make copy, store,
                        etc. of any material/Work that I register with FilmGinny Corporation (FGC).

                        H. All the information I have provided to SWA while registering this Work is true and
                        accurate, and I have not concealed any material fact herewith.

                        I. I shall fully indemnify and defend FilmGinny Corporation (FGC) for any cost and losses
                        incurred
                        to SWA due to any
                        proven claim of the infringement of copyright, personality right, privacy right, life right,
                        defamation, related rights or any civil/criminal claims arising out of this registered Work
                        by any person at any point of time.

                        J. If I violate any of the above undertakings, FilmGinny Corporation (FGC) is entitled to (a)
                        cancel
                        the
                        registration immediately (b) take legal and disciplinary action against me. As a consequence
                        of registration cancellation, I cannot use, transfer, store, distribute, make available to
                        public or exploit the registered Work in any manner whatsoever. Further, SWA shall not
                        testify regarding the date of the registration in case of an authorship dispute.

                        K. I further affirm that I understand the content of this declaration and accept the same.
                        All the information and statements mentioned hereinabove are true and correct to the best of
                        my knowledge, belief and understanding. If anything mentioned above is incorrect, I
                        understand it will be an offence of Perjury, and I will be solely responsible for the
                        consequences arising thereafter Including but not limited to legal action, disciplinary
                        action, cancellation of registration, publicly announcing the default wherever SWA deems
